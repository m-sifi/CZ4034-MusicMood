# CZ4034-MusicMood

This is the repository containing source code for the CZ4034 Information Retrieval project. 

There are two folders: `frontend` and `backend`. 

To run the frontend, refer to the readme [in the frontend folder](https://github.com/m-sifi/CZ4034-MusicMood/tree/main/frontend#readme). To run the backend, refer to the readme [in the backend folder](https://github.com/m-sifi/CZ4034-MusicMood/tree/main/backend#readme).

Note that you must manually download `pytorch_model.bin` from the Google Drive folder and save it at this location: `CZ4034-MusicMood/backend/models/juliensimon-autonlp-song-lyrics/`. We did not directly upload it to this repository due to the size.
